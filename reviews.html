					I was from Electronics branch and was looking to learn coding. During my engineering period I have never imagined that I'll learn 
                    coding as it was something I was never able to understand. But after covid I realised that I need to learn this skill as it can help
                    us survive in any situation as few of my friends who was from CS/IT branch they were still working while we were laid off from the 
                    office. Tap Academy has provided me the platform using which I was able to learn basics of Java and even still I am learning different 
                    concepts while the our mentor is very helpful she helps us in all the possible way.

					Hello, I am Gowtham I am a fresher from ECE background. I have been enrolled in tap academy since may 2023 in full stack java 
                    development Course. This course has really helped me to achieve knowledge in java and other laguages like Html, Css and JavaScript. 
                    The augmented reality used by TapAcademy helped me a lot in a detailed manner from the memory point of view. So from my point of view
                    if anyone asks me about the TapAcademy. And it really helped me a lot and thanks for the TapAcademy, because it helped me a lot and in 
                    future I will not only gain a job but I am confident, and this is a basic pillar to me Mam. Thank you once again.

                    Being from non IT background but still felt some missing pieces which TapAcademy has been filling. I have never felt such kind of experience anywhere. From explaining things in visual forms to bringing countless placement offers for us. And my basic is so strong now. College definitely has a curriculum and they have to follow it but here they are so focused on building our basics, personality and everything. Best experience honestly.

					Hello, I am Khaja I am a fresher from ECE background. I have been enrolled in tap academy since may 2023 in full stack java 
                    development Course. This course has really helped me to achieve knowledge in java and other laguages like Html, Css and JavaScript. 
                    The augmented reality used by TapAcademy helped me a lot in a detailed manner from the memory point of view. So from my point of view
                    if anyone asks me about the TapAcademy. And it really helped me a lot and thanks for the TapAcademy, because it helped me a lot and in 
                    future I will not only gain a job but I am confident, and this is a basic pillar to me Mam. Thank you once again.
